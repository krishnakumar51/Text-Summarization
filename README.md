# Text Summarization with Pegasus

This project demonstrates text summarization using Pegasus, a state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model developed by Google. Pegasus is trained specifically for abstractive summarization tasks.

## Overview

Text summarization is the process of distilling the most important information from a text document into a concise summary. With Pegasus, we can generate summaries that capture the essence of the input text, making it easier to comprehend large volumes of information quickly.

## Features

- **State-of-the-art Model**: Utilizes Pegasus, a pre-trained model fine-tuned for text summarization tasks.
- **Efficient Summarization**: Generates abstractive summaries by understanding the context and semantics of the input text.
- **Easy-to-use Pipeline**: Integrates seamlessly with the Hugging Face `transformers` library, making it straightforward to implement summarization tasks.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare your text data for summarization. Ensure it is in a suitable format compatible with Pegasus input requirements.

2. **Model Loading**: Load the pre-trained Pegasus model using the `AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM` class from the `transformers` library.

3. **Summarization**: Use the loaded model to generate summaries for your input text.

4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the quality of the generated summaries using metrics such as ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation).

5. **Deployment**: Once satisfied with the performance, deploy the model for real-world applications, such as summarizing news articles, customer reviews, or legal documents.
